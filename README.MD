🎓 School Data Cleaning and Academic Performance Analysis ProjectA structured data engineering project focused on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing raw student academic data using Python and Pandas. This project showcases skills in data wrangling, pipeline development, and visualization to uncover insights about student performance across subjects and classes.---📌 Project ObjectiveTo clean, standardize, and analyze a raw student dataset to identify key academic performance trends. The analysis focuses on subject-wise grade distributions, average scores by class, and identification of top-performing students and subjects. This project demonstrates practical data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis relevant for education analytics and data engineering roles.---🧹 Data Cleaning Highlights- Removed duplicate and null records- Normalized column names (snake_case)- Standardized text formatting- Exported a clean dataset ready for analysis> See: [`scripts/clean_data.py`](scripts/clean_data.py)---📊 Data Analysis & VisualizationPerformed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebook to generate:- 📊 Grade distributions for Math, Science, and English (Histograms/Boxplots)- 🎓 Average scores by Class (Bar charts)- 🏆 Identification of top-performing students and subjects- 👥 Demographic insights such as age distributions (if available)> See: [`notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb)  > Visuals saved in [`visuals/`](visuals/) directory---## 📁 Project Structure```bashSchool-data-project/├── data/                   # Raw and cleaned CSV data├── notebooks/              # Jupyter notebooks for EDA├── scripts/                # Python scripts for cleaning├── visuals/                # Output charts and plots├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies└── README.md               # Project overview and instructions
