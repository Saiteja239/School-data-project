 School Data Management Project Project OverviewThis project implements a robust data pipeline to manage, clean, and analyze student academic data. Built with Python and Pandas, the pipeline extracts student records from a CSV source, performs data cleaning and transformation, and generates meaningful summaries to support academic insights. Key Features- Data Ingestion: Loads student data efficiently from CSV files.- Data Cleaning: Handles missing or incomplete data by imputing median or mean values.- Data Processing: Calculates average scores across subjects.- Reporting: Provides aggregated student counts by class.- Modular Design: Easily extensible Python codebase for further analytics or integration. Technologies Used- Python 3.6+- Pandas (for data manipulation)- CSV file format for data storage Prerequisites- Python 3.6 or higher installed- pip package manager
